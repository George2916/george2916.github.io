        <h4 class="anecdotesText2"><p>In the late '90s and very early aughts, Uncle George and Aunt Sunghee would visit the Greenslades at their house outside Boston almost every Easter weekend. While there, they would, among other things, play tag with Haley and Abigail and paint Easter eggs. After the paint on the Easter eggs had dried, Uncle George taught them how to break the shells on their heads. So, a good time was had by all.</p><p>On the day of the expected arrival of Uncle George and Aunt Sunghee, young Haley and Abigail would periodically go to the front door of their house, press their noses against the glass, and wait for Uncle George and Aunt Sungee to pull into their driveway. On more than one occasion when so situated, Haley asked her parents "Are they almost here yet?"</p></h4>

          <h4 class="anecdotesText2">The house that the Greenslades owned in Topsfield had a long passageway from the steps leading up to the second floor to the kitchen. When Aidan was about 2 1/2 years old, Uncle George, Aunt Sunghee and cousin George were visiting Topsfield and were in the kitchen talking with Aidan's parents when Uncle George saw Aidan walking down the passageway towards the kitchen. What was noteworthy was that Aidan, on this particular occasion, was completely naked. He proceeded to enter the kitchen, walk up to his mother, turn his back to her so as to better expose his posterior, spread his butt cheeks, and proudly declaim, "Look, Mom, I cleaned myself!" </h4>
